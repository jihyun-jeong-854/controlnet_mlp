# ControlNet-different backbones
In this fork of the original ControlNet repo, we evaluated the possibility of using lighter backbones for ControlNet model instead of Stable Diffusion encoder.
Our experiments and findings are described here: https://medium.com/@dzvinkayarish/controlnetlite-smaller-and-faster-controlnet-55b26cef946e .
The project was inspired by this discussion https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet/discussions/188 .
